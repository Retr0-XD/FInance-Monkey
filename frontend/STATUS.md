## Tech Debt
- Revisit the Material-UI v7 Grid component implementations across the application
- Refactor component types to ensure proper TypeScript support

## Known Issues
- TypeScript errors in Grid component props need to be fixed (grid component usage different in MUI v7)
- Local storage auth token handling needs to be aligned with NextAuth session management
