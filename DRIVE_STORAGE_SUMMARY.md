# Google Drive Storage Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a Google Drive storage solution for Finance Monkey that allows the application to:
1. Store processed transaction data as JSON files in Google Drive
2. Retrieve transaction data from Google Drive when needed
3. Operate without requiring a persistent database connection

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend
1. **New Configuration Files**
   - `GoogleDriveConfig.java`: Configuration for Google Drive API integration
   - Added Google Drive API dependency to `build.gradle`
   - Added Drive-related configuration to `application.yml`
   - Created placeholder `credentials.json` for Google API credentials

2. **New Services**
   - `GoogleDriveService.java`: Core service for interacting with Google Drive API
   - `DriveBackedTransactionService.java`: Service for storing transactions in Google Drive

3. **New APIs**
   - `DriveStorageController.java`: REST endpoints for Drive storage operations
   - Added export, retrieve, and admin migration endpoints

4. **Health Monitoring**
   - `GoogleDriveHealthIndicator.java`: Health check for Google Drive connectivity

5. **Repository Updates**
   - Updated `TransactionRepository.java` with methods to support Google Drive integration

6. **Documentation**
   - Created `GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE.md` with setup instructions
   - Updated `README.md` to include Google Drive storage information
   - Created `DESIGN_Improved.MD` with updated architecture details

### Frontend
1. **New Utilities**
   - `driveStorage.js`: Utility functions for interacting with Drive storage APIs

2. **New Components**
   - `DriveStorage.jsx`: React component for managing Drive storage
   - `DriveStoragePage.jsx`: Page component for Drive storage management

3. **Styling**
   - `DriveStorage.css`: Styles for the Drive storage components

## Flow Implementation
1. **Scheduled Export**: Automatic monthly export to Google Drive
2. **Manual Export**: User-triggered export via API
3. **Data Retrieval**: API endpoints to fetch latest transactions from Drive
4. **File Management**: View file history and access files directly in Google Drive

## Configuration Requirements
1. **Google API Credentials**:
   - Can reuse existing OAuth 2.0 credentials (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)
   - Just enable Google Drive API access for your project in the Google Cloud Console
   - No need for separate credentials if you already have Google authentication set up

2. **Application Configuration**:
   - Added Drive-specific properties in `application.yml`
   - Set up scheduled tasks for automatic export

## Security Considerations
1. OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access to Google Drive
2. Authorization checks on all API endpoints
3. User data isolation through user-specific file naming

## Next Steps
1. Complete the integration testing
2. Set up proper Google API credentials
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Implement additional frontend features for file management
